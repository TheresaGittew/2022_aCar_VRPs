Numerical results for CI (CÃ´te d'Ivoire) and Ethiopia (ET):

Sub-folders contain results for one scenario tested.
Every scenario has a service combination and a specific coverage of the pilot region.
Folder have the following names:

Example:
scenario_['ELEC']_12 0.22
ELEC => Service combination
12 => # Delivery points in that scenario
0.22 => Percentage of target area in that scenario

Folders contain these files:
1) DecisionvariableValues.xlsx => Numerical results for the tested instance;
every solution variable has one tab, and tab 'obj' Val shows objective value, comp. time [s] and mip gap
2) DecisionvariableValues_PP.xlsx => Numerical results after post-processing (applied heuristic for finding better routes)
3).png-files: Plotted Routes for all days + 'PVRP_Day--1': file with active customers
